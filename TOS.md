# Bot's Privacy Policy
In the following paragraphs it is stated, what all Data the Bot is using and saving.



# What Data does Sentinel collect specifically?
For Database purposes it needs to store IDS of Guilds, Users and Channels. Further more it also stores Informationdata provided by the discord Api, for presences, statuses, appearances, channel and member lists, etc. due to caching technologies. When making settings adjustments, those are stored too. Same applies on providing custom text for custom settings.

In the extend I am also saving statistics, for when someone uses a Command from me, for the history Command. However that's limited to the latest 150 Elements



# Where or how is this Data stored?
Discord related Data are stored on a dragonfly cache instance on the same machine as the Milrato Bot near the DC Hosting Company Location of Discord. Milrato is not affiliated with Discord, meaningwhich if you want to remove every single cached data about you, you need to contact the Support Server.

Data which are settings, or permament, like favorite songs, user settings, command settings, are stored in a relational Database. Which get's deleted if the User / Server get's unavailable from the Bot, by kicking / banning it from there.



# What are your Limitations?
